66794d0dd575271fd9127c03,Employee Scheduling," Organizations whose employees work multiple shifts need to schedule sufficient workers for each daily shift. Typically the schedules will have constraints such as ""no employee should work two shifts in a row"". Finding a schedule that satisfies all constraints can be computationally difficult.", Scheduling
66794d0dd575271fd9127c04,Vehicle Routing Problem," In the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) the goal is to find optimal routes for multiple vehicles visiting a set of locations. (When there's only one vehicle it reduces to the Traveling Salesperson Problem.) But what do we mean by ""optimal routes"" for a VRP? One answer is the routes with the least total distance. However if there are no other constraints the optimal solution is to assign just one vehicle to visit all locations and find the shortest route for that vehicle. This is essentially the same problem as the TSP. A better way to define optimal routes is to minimize the length of the longest single route among all vehicles. This is the right definition if the goal is to complete all deliveries as soon as possible. The VRP example below finds optimal routes defined this way.", Routing
66794d0dd575271fd9127c05,The Knapsack Problem, In the knapsack problem you need to pack a set of items with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes) into a container with a maximum capacity . If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity you can't pack them all. In that case the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container., Packing
66794d0dd575271fd9127c06,Linear Sum Assignment Solver, Linear Sum Assignment Solver is a specialized solver for the simple assignment problem which can be faster than either the MIP or CP-SAT solver. However the MIP and CP-SAT solvers can handle a much wider array of problems so in most cases they are the best option., Assignment
66794d0dd575271fd9127c07,Solving a MIP Problem, To solve a MIP problem your program should include the following steps: 1. Import the linear solver wrapper 2. declare the MIP solver 3. define the variables 4. define the constraints 5. define the objective 6. call the MIP solver and 7. display the solution, Integer Optimization
66794d0dd575271fd9127c08,Solving an LP Problem, To solve a LP problem your program should include the following steps: 1. Import the linear solver wrapper 2. declare the LP solver 3. define the variables 4. define the constraints 5. define the objective 6. call the LP solver; and 7. display the solution, Linear Optimization
66794d0dd575271fd9127c09,Minimum Cost Flows, In the Minimum Cost Flows problem each arc in the graph has a unit cost for transporting material across it. The problem is to find a flow with the least total cost. The min cost flow problem also has special nodes called supply nodes or demand nodes which are similar to the source and sink in the max flow problem. Material is transported from supply nodes to demand nodes. At a supply node a positive amount — the supply — is added to the flow. A supply could represent production at that node for example. At a demand node a negative amount — the demand — is taken away from the flow. A demand could represent consumption at that node for example., Network Flows
